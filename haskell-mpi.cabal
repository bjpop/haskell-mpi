synopsis:            Distributed parallel programming in Haskell using MPI.
description:
 MPI is defined by the Message-Passing Interface Standard,
 as specified by the Message Passing Interface Forum. The latest release
 of the standard is known as MPI-2. These Haskell
 bindings are designed to work with any standards compliant
 implementation of MPI-2. Examples are MPICH2:
 <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2> and
 OpenMPI: <http://www.open-mpi.org>.
 .
 In addition to reading these documents, users may also find it
 beneficial to consult the MPI-2 standard documentation provided by the
 MPI Forum: <http://www.mpi-forum.org>, and also the documentation for
 the MPI implementation linked to this library (that is, the MPI
 implementation that was chosen when this Haskell library was compiled).
 .
 "Control.Parallel.MPI.Fast" contains a high-performance interface
 for working with (possibly mutable) arrays of storable Haskell data types.
 .
 "Control.Parallel.MPI.Simple" contains a convenient (but slower)
 interface for sending arbitrary serializable Haskell data values as messages.
 .
 "Control.Parallel.MPI.Internal" contains a direct binding to the
 C interface.
 .
 "Control.Parallel.MPI.Base" contains essential MPI functionality
 which is independent of the message passing API. This is re-exported
 by the Fast and Simple modules, and usually does not need to be
 explcitly imported itself.
 .
 Notable differences between Haskell-MPI and the standard C interface to MPI:
 .
    1. Some collective message passing operations are split into send
       and receive parts to facilitate a more idiomatic Haskell style of programming.
       For example, C provides the @MPI_Gather@ function which is called
       by all processes participating in the communication, whereas
       Haskell-MPI provides 'gatherSend' and 'gatherRecv' which are called
       by the sending and receiving processes respectively.
 .
    2. The order of arguments for some functions is changed to allow
       for the most common patterns of partial function application.
 .
    3. Errors are raised as exceptions rather than return codes (assuming
       that the error handler to 'errorsThrowExceptions', otherwise errors
       will terminate the computation just like C interface).
 .
      Below is a small but complete MPI program. Process 1 sends the message
      @\"Hello World\"@ to process 0, which in turn receives the message and
      prints it to standard output. All other processes, if there are any,
      do nothing.
 .

      >      else case rank of
      >         0 -> do (msg, _status) <- recv commWorld 1 unitTag
      >                 putStrLn msg
      >         1 -> send commWorld 0 unitTag "Hello World"
      >         _ -> return ()
