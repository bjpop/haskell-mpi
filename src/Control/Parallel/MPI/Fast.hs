This module provides the ability to transfer via MPI any Haskell value that could be
represented by some MPI type without expensive conversion or serialization.

Most of the \"primitive\" Haskell types could be treated this way, along with Storable and IO Arrays. Full range of point-to-point and collective operation is supported, including for reduce and similar operations.

Typeclass 'SendFrom' incapsulates the act of representing Haskell value as a flat memory region that could be used as a \"send buffer\" in MPI calls.

Likewise, 'RecvInto' captures the rules for using Haskell value as a \"receive buffer\" in MPI calls.

Correspondence between Haskell types and MPI types is encoded in 'Repr' typeclass.

Below is a small but complete MPI program utilising this Module. Process 0 sends the array of @Int@s
process 1. Process 1 receives the message and prints it
to standard output. It assumes that there are at least 2 MPI processes
available. Further examples in this module would provide different implementation of
@process@ function.

In-place receive vs new array allocation for Storable Array
-----------------------------------------------------------
When using StorableArray API in tight numeric loops, it is best to
reuse existing arrays and avoid penalties incurred by
allocation/deallocation of memory. Which is why destinations/receive
buffers in StorableArray API are specified exclusively as
(StorableArray i e).

If you'd rather allocate new array for a particular operation, you
could use withNewArray/withNewArray_:

Instead of (recv comm rank tag arr) you would write
(arr <- withNewArray bounds $ recv comm rank tag), and new array would
be allocated, supplied as the target of the (recv) operation and
returned to you.

You could easily write your own convenience wrappers similar to
withNewArray. For example, you could create wrapper that would take an
array size as a simple number instead of range.

-}


{- | Helper wrapper function that would allocate array of the given size and use it as receive buffer, without the need to
preallocate it explicitly.

Most of the functions in this API could reuse receive buffer (like 'StorableArray') over and over again.
If you do not have preallocated buffer you could use this wrapper to get yourself one.

Consider the following code that uses preallocated buffer:

@
scattervRecv root comm arr
@

Same code with buffer allocation:

@
(arr,status) <- intoNewArray range $ scattervRecv root comm
@

{-| Receive 'StorableArray' from the process identified by @(Comm, Rank, Tag)@ in non-blocking mode.

At the moment we are limiting this to 'StorableArray's because they
are compatible with C pointers. This means that the received data can
be written directly to the array, and does not have to be copied out
at the end. This is important for the non-blocking operation of @irecv@.

It is not safe to copy the data from the C pointer until the transfer
is complete. So any array type which requires copying of data after
receipt of the message would have to wait on complete transmission.
It is not clear how to incorporate the waiting automatically into
the same interface as the one below. One option is to use a Haskell
thread to do the data copying in the \"background\" (as was done for 'Simple.irecv'). Another option
is to introduce a new kind of data handle which would encapsulate the
wait operation, and would allow the user to request the data to be
copied when the wait was complete.

{- | Treat @v@ as send buffer suitable for the purposes of this API.

Method 'sendFrom' is expected to deduce how to use @v@ as a memory-mapped buffer that consist of a number of
elements of some 'Datatype'. It would then call the supplied function, passing it the pointer to the buffer,
its size (in elements) and type of the element.

Note that @e@ is not bound by the typeclass, so all kinds of foul play
are possible. However, since MPI declares all buffers as @void*@ anyway,
we are not making life all /that/ unsafe with this.

Binds a user-dened reduction operation to an 'Operation' handle that can
subsequently be used in 'reduceSend', 'reduceRecv', 'allreduce', and 'reduceScatter'.
The user-defined operation is assumed to be associative.

If first argument to @opCreate@ is @True@, then the operation should be both commutative and associative. If
it is not commutative, then the order of operands is fixed and is defined to be in ascending,
process rank order, beginning with process zero. The order of evaluation can be changed,
taking advantage of the associativity of the operation. If operation
is commutative then the order
of evaluation can be changed, taking advantage of commutativity and
associativity.

User-defined operation accepts four arguments, @invec@, @inoutvec@,
@len@ and @datatype@ and applies reduction operation to the elements
of @invec@ and @inoutvec@ in pariwise manner. In pseudocode:

@
for i in [0..len-1] { inoutvec[i] = op invec[i] inoutvec[i] }
@

Full example with user-defined function that mimics standard operation
'sumOp':
